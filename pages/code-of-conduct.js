								INTRODUCTION
							</h2>
							<p className="mx-auto text-lg text-white">
								This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Evil
								Bees, including but not limited to: all public and private
								mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter; as well as
								any other communication channel used by our communities. A code
								of conduct which is specific to in-person events (ie.,
								conferences) is codified in the published ASF anti-harassment
								policy. We expect this code of conduct to be honored by all who
								participate in the Evil Bees community formally or informally,
								or claim any affiliation with the community, in any
								community-related activities and especially when representing
								the Evil Bees, in any role. This code is{" "}
								<strong>not exhaustive or complete</strong>. It serves to
								distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared
								environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as
								much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the
								technical communities in which we participate.

							<p className="font-medium text-xl font-bold tracking-tight py-4">
								We strive to:
							</p>
							<ul className="list-disc">
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Be open.</strong> We invite anyone to participate in
									our community. We preferably use public methods of
									communication for project-related messages, unless discussing
									something sensitive. This applies to messages regarding help
									or project-related support, too. Not only is a public support
									request much more likely to result in an answer to a question,
									it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by
									people answering will be more easily detected and corrected.
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>
										Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.
									</strong>{" "}
									We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions,
									and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all
									experience some frustration from time to time, but we can not
									allow frustration to turn into any sort of personal attack.
									After all, a community where people feel uncomfortable or
									threatened is not a productive one. It&apos;s imperative for
									all to remain respectful when dealing with other community
									members as well as those outside of our community.
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Be collaborative.</strong> Our work will be used by
									other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of
									others. When we make something for the benefit of the project,
									we must be willing to explain to others how it works, so that
									they can build on the work to make it even better. Any
									decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take
									those consequences seriously when making decisions.
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Be inquisitive.</strong> Nobody knows everything!
									Asking questions early on avoids many problems later. Thus,
									questions are encouraged, although they ought to be directed
									to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be
									responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal
									of improving the Evil Bees codebase.
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Be careful in with words you choose to use.</strong>{" "}
									Whether you are are participating as a professional or a
									volunteer, we value professionalism in all interactions, and
									take responsibility for our own words. Be kind to others.
									Never insult or put down other participants. Harassment and
									other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable nor will they
									be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:
									<ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-4 pt-4 pb-6">
										<li>
											Violent threats or language directed against another
											person.
										</li>
										<li>
											Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and
											language.
										</li>
										<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
										<li>
											Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#39;s
											personally identifying information (&quot;aka
											doxing&quot;).
										</li>
										<li>
											Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or
											non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel
											history.
										</li>
										<li>
											Personal insults, especially those with racist or sexist
											undertones.
										</li>
										<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
										<li>Excessive or unnecessary use of profanities.</li>
										<li>
											Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks
											you to stop, then stop.
										</li>
										<li>
											Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the aforementioned
											behavior or language.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Be concise.</strong> Keep in mind that what you write
									once will be read by hundreds of people. Writing a short email
									means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as
									possible. Short emails should also strive to be empathetic,
									welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is
									necessary, consider adding a summary. Try to bring new ideas
									to a conversation so that each mail adds something unique to
									the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still
									contains the other messages with arguments that have already
									been made. Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions
									that are already fairly large.
								</li>
								<li className="pb-2">
									<strong>Step down considerately.</strong> Members of every
									project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from
									the project they should tell people they are leaving and take
									the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they
									left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those
									who continue to participate in the project and should not
									misrepresent the project&#39;s goals or achievements.
									Likewise, community members should respect any
									individual&#39;s choice to leave the project.

									DIVERSITY STATEMENT
								</h2>
								<p>
									Evil Bees welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
									We are committed to being a community that consists of
									lighthearted jokes and positive interactions. Although we may
									not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat
									everyone as best we can. No matter how you identify yourself
									or how others perceive you - we welcome you. Though no list
									can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity
									in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or
									expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype,
									political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual
									orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
									ability.Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Evil
									Bees development is conducted in English. Standards for
									behavior in the Evil Bees community are detailed in the Code
									of Conduct above. We expect participants in our community to
									meet these standards in all their interactions and to
									encourage others to do so as well.

									REPORTING GUIDELINES
								</h2>
								<p>
									While this code of conduct should be adhered to by
									participants, we recognize that sometimes people may have a
									bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this code
									of conduct. When that happens, you may message them in order
									to point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in
									public or in private, whatever feels most appropriate.
									However, regardless of whether the message is posted publicly
									or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this
									code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or
									disrespectful.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, assume good faith. It is more likely that
									participants are unaware of their bad behavior and are not
									intentionally trying to degrade the quality of the discussion.
									Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation,
									you may report your compliance issues in confidence to either:

								Discord Community Guidelines
							</h2>
							<p className="pt-2">
								If you decide to join the{" "}
								<a href="https://discord.gg/rvxGNrFhNz">Community Discord</a>,
								please adhere to the following rules:
							</p>

							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								1. Treat everyone in the community with respect.
							</h3>
							<p>
								We strive to make this community a welcoming place for people -
								from all industries, use cases, geographies, backgrounds and
								walks of life. Harassment of any kind is not acceptable and
								won&apos;t be tolerated.
							</p>
							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								2. Use the right channel
							</h3>
							<p>
								Channels are an effective way for organizing and focusing
								discussions while also empowering members to opt-in to the types
								of content they&apos;re interested in. When questions are posted
								or discussions are started in the wrong channel, it dilutes the
								trust of the members in the channel and, more practically, makes
								it harder for your questions to be answered.
							</p>
							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								3. Ask thoughtful questions
							</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										We&apos;re all here to help each other out. The best way to
										get help is by investing effort into your questions. First
										check and see if your question is answered in Github Wiki,
										Discord Channels or in the project&apos;s README. Then, use
										Discord search to see if your question has already been
										asked and answered in the past. If you still feel the need
										to ask a question, make sure you include:
									</p>
								</li>
								<ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-4 pt-4 pb-6">
									<li>The steps you&apos;ve already taken</li>
									<li>
										Relevant details presented cleanly (text stacktraces,
										formatted markdown, or screenshots. Please don&apos;t paste
										large blocks of code unformatted or post photos of your
										screen from your phone).
									</li>
									<li>
										The specific question you have or the specific type of help
										you&#39;re seeking.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								4. Avoid double posting
							</h3>
							<p>
								This Discord community is not a customer support channel and all
								members are here voluntarily. If you aren’t getting a response
								to a question you have, make sure you look at rules 1, 2, and 3.
								It’s also worth remembering that there may not be someone in the
								community who has the context to help you out.
							</p>
							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								5. Communicate openly
							</h3>
							<p>
								Unless you have explicit permission from the person, please
								avoid sending direct messages to individuals. Communicating in
								public channels ensures that we&apos;re all respecting each
								other&apos;s attentions and we can scalably moderate our
								communication to mitigate harassment or discrimination. Do not
								use direct messages to pitch products and services. If you are
								receiving unwelcome direct messages, please notify an admin.
							</p>
							<h3 className="text-xl font-bold pt-6 pb-3">
								6. Practice good Discord hygiene by using threads for
								discussions and emojis for light reactions
							</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The medium is the message. Discord can foster a welcoming,
									collaborative, and organized community when used effectively.
									We want to respect people&apos;s attentions (thread
									notifications &gt; channel notifications &gt; DM
									notifications) and we want to improve information density (a
									member should be able to browse and explore many convo
									threads, not just see one thread discussed in a top level
									channel).
