					Why Open Source?
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight">
					When we started working as developers, the world felt like a lonely,
					cruel place at times. The lack of communication and collaboration was
					damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering their growth. We
					quickly took note of the fact that open-source projects, in addition
					to being more time-efficient and cost-affective are an amazing
					opportunity to grow for all. No matter what your skill level is, or
					which languages your well-versed in, there is always space for you to
					contribute and make the project better â€” while honing your skills and
					growing as a developer. The end result: The world receives an amazing
					product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get invaluable
					experience, as well as a supportive collaborative community.
