Monitoring everything that matters to you.

Website observation
Know right away if your website is offline! Reliable monitoring saves you money by alerting you before any major problems arise.

Monitoring pings
Utilize one of the instruments that administrators use the most frequently to verify the availability of network devices.

Port surveillance
Is email service still available? What about the crucial database server, for instance? Let's verify! Track any specified service that is active on any port.

Keyword monitoring

Check the presence of the specific text in the content of the site by crawling it whenever you want.

Provide updates on incidents
To the subscribers of your Status page, send out status updates through email or other services you support.

Response periods
View your response times as a graph to identify performance blips.

There are times when things go wrong.
Be informed!
Even the strongest among us have downtime. However, it's crucial to be aware of it before clients are impacted!

Using status pages, you can inform your consumers about incidents.
Be open-minded. Customers should be informed of scheduled interruptions. Show them how you are thriving to provide a 100% online service.
